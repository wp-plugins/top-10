WordPress doesn't count page views by default. <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/top-10/">Top 10</a> will count the number of page views on your single posts on a daily as well as overall basis. You can then display the page view count on individual posts and pages as well as display a list of most popular posts based on page views.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If your question isn't listed here, please post a comment at the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/top-10">WordPress.org support forum</a>. I monitor the forums on an ongoing basis. If you're looking for more advanced support, please see <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/support/">details here</a>.

= How can I customise the output? =

Several customization options are available via the Settings page in WordPress Admin. You can access this via <strong>Settings &raquo; Top 10</strong>

The plugin also provides you with a set of CSS classes that allow you to style your posts by adding code to the *style.css* sheet. In a future version, I will be adding in CSS support within the plugins Settings page.

The following CSS classes / IDs are available:

* **tptn_related**: ID of the main wrapper `div`. This is only displayed on singular pages, i.e. post, page and attachment

* **tptn_related**: Class of the main wrapper `div`. If you are displaying the related posts on non-singular pages, then you should style this

* **tptn_title**: Class of the `span` tag for title of the post

* **tptn_excerpt**: Class of the `span` tag for excerpt (if included)

* **tptn_thumb**: Class of the post thumbnail `img` tag

* **tptn_list_count**: Class of the `span` tag for post count in top posts list

* **tptn_counter**: Class of the `div` tag that wraps the post count that is driven by the field "Format to display the count in: " under 'Output Options'

= How does the plugin select thumbnails? =

The plugin selects thumbnails in the following order:

1. Post Thumbnail image: The image that you can set while editing your post in WordPress &raquo; New Post screen

2. Post meta field: This is the meta field value you can use when editing your post. The default is `post-image`

3. First image in the post: The plugin will try to fetch the first image in the post

3. Video Thumbnails: Meta field set by <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/video-thumbnails/">Video Thumbnails</a>

4. Default Thumbnail: If enabled, it will use the default thumbnail that you specify in the Settings screen

The plugin uses <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/timthumb/">timthumb</a> to generate thumbnails by default. Depending on the configuration of your webhost you might run into certain problems. Please check out <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2010/11/timthumb-hints-tips/">the timthumb troubleshooting page</a> regarding permission settings for the folder and files.

= Manual install =

You may choose to not display the post count automatically. If you do so, then in order to display the post count, you will need to add `<?php if(function_exists('echo_tptn_post_count')) echo_tptn_post_count(); ?>`.

In order to display the most popular posts, you will need to add `<?php if(function_exists('tptn_show_pop_posts')) tptn_show_pop_posts(); ?>`.

In order to display the most popular posts, you will need to add `<?php if(function_exists('tptn_show_daily_pop_posts')) tptn_show_daily_pop_posts(); ?>`.

You can also use the WordPress Widgets to display the popular posts in your sidebar / other widgetized areas of your theme.

= Can this plugin replace Google Analytics? =

Never. This plugin is designed to only track the number of pageviews on your blog posts and display the same. It cannot replace Google Analytics or any other full fledged statistics application.

= How does the scheduled maintenance work maintenance work? =

When you enabled the scheduled maintenance, Top 10 will create a cron job that will run at a predefined interval and truncate the `wp_top_ten_daily` table. 
*Note: If you enable this option, WordPress will execute this job when it is scheduled the first time*

== Wishlist ==

Below are a few features that I plan on implementing in future versions of the plugin. However, there is no fixed time-frame for this and largely depends on how much time I can contribute to development.

* Select random posts if there are no similar posts
* Top posts by comments
* Smart tracking of hits, i.e. no update on page reload of same visitors within a certain time period
* Shortcode support
* Exclude display on select categories and tags
* Exclude display on select posts 
* Custom post support
* Multi-site support
* Ready-made styles
* Upload your own default thumbnail


If you would like a feature to be added, or if you already have the code for the feature, you can let us know by <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/top-10">posting in this forum</a>.
