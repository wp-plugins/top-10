Count pageviews on posts and display a list of top posts

== Description ==

WordPress doesn't count page views by default. <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/top-10/">Top 10</a> will count the number of page views on your single posts and store them in the database.

You can then display the page view count on individual posts and pages as well as display a list of most popular posts based on page views.

Includes a sidebar widget to display the popular posts. And, all settings can be configured from within your WordPress Admin area itself!


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin

2. Extract the contents of top-10.zip to wp-content/plugins/ folder. You should get a folder called top-10.

3. Activate the Plugin in WP-Admin. 

4. Goto Settings > Top 10 to configure

5. Goto Appearance > Widgets to add the Popular Posts sidebar widget to your theme
