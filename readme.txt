WordPress doesn't count page views by default. <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/top-10/">Top 10</a> will count the number of page views on your single posts on a daily as well as overall basis. You can then display the page view count on individual posts and pages as well as display a list of most popular posts based on page views.

Includes a sidebar widget to display the popular posts. And, all settings can be configured from within your WordPress Admin area itself! You can choose to disable tracking of author visits on their own posts.
